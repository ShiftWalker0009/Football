      <p>Football's history dates back centuries. Ancient games like *cuju* in China and *kemari* in Japan involved kicking a ball without using hands. In medieval Europe, "mob football" was chaotic and had few rules.

        Modern football emerged in 1863 when The Football Association (FA) in England standardized the rules, distinguishing it from rugby. The sport spread worldwide, leading to the formation of FIFA in 1904 and the first FIFA World Cup in 1930.
        
        Today, football is the world's most popular sport, evolving with technology like VAR and goal-line technology while uniting people across cultures.</p>
